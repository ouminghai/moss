/**
 * The generic ERC-721 protocol: transfer any NFT by collection address and
 * token id, plus ownership queries. Fills the `nft` category the same way
 * the generic erc20 protocol fills `transfer` for fungibles.
 *
 * Interface-layer resident by the ADR 0009 test: the collection address is
 * naturally a call-time parameter (which NFT to move is the user's input),
 * so this is a DYNAMIC-ADDRESS protocol — `contracts: {}`, injected
 * `runtime`, Handles built per call. Collections are NOT in the token table
 * (that catalog is fungible-only); agents pass the 0x address explicitly.
